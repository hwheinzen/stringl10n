# stringl10n
String localization tools for Go

Main object is the localization of error messages.

To create suitable errors use the type `Err` from package `mistake`.

To enrich errors with context, e.g. to build kind of trace, wrap them using `fmt.Errorf` and `%w` from the standard library.

To localize, use the translation tools, e.g. function L10nLocalizeError, generated by the `l10n` command.

### Pre-2020 
Package `message` and the `stringl10n` command are considered deprecated.

Command `stringl10nextract` lacks sophistication but is still useful.

### Install
Provided that your Go environment is ready, just do:

`$ go get github.com/hwheinzen/stringl10n/...`

### Example
Some example code can be found in cmd/l10n/example.
