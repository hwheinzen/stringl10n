# stringl10n
String localization tools for Go

Main use for these tools is the localization of error messages.

- To create suitable errors use the type `Err` from package `mistake`.

- To enrich errors with context, e.g. to build kind of trace, wrap them using `fmt.Errorf` and `%w` from the standard library.

- To localize, use the translation tools, e.g. function L10nLocalizeError, generated by the `l10n` command.

- To generate and to update the JSON input file for `l10n` use the `l10nextract` command.


### OBSOLETE
The older package `message` and the older commands `stringl10n` and `stringl10nextract` are considered deprecated.


### Usage
Use `"github.com/hwheinzen/stringl10n/mistake"` in your project's import statements.

To get the commands `l10n` and `l10nextract` do:

`$ go install github.com/hwheinzen/stringl10n/cmd/l10n@latest`
`$ go install github.com/hwheinzen/stringl10n/cmd/l10nextract@latest`

(But maybe you like to have all sources at hand: clone the repository then.)


### Example
Some example code can be found in cmd/l10n/example.
